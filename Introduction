Synthetic jets: Synthetic jets is a type of flow control technique in fluid mechanics in order to control the boundary layer, application in heat transfer and mixing enhancement.
It does not have any external flow supply but rather includes a diaphragm or actuator in order to ingest or expel the fluid, so it is less complex compared to the pulse jet system as the pulse jet system includes an external 
pressurized fluid source.
The differences between pulse jet and synthetic jets are listed below:
a) Net mass flux: Synthetic jets do not have any net mass flux as there is no external supply while a pulsed jet has a net mass flux. Synthetic jets are also known as the zero net mass flux systems
b) Fluid source: Synthetic jets are self supplied with no fluid source while a pulsed jet includes a pressurized fluid supply.
c) Velocity range: Synthetic jets operate for a lowe velocity range and pulse jet operate at a higher range.
d) Re: Synthetic jets are used for a comparatively lower Re
e) Control mechanism: A diaphragm or an actuator to control the inlet flow
f) Complexity: The design of a synthetic jets is more simpler.

In a SJ: The flow field is more unsteady due to the presence of movement of the actuator. Due to the periodic formation and advection of vortex rings from the orifice exit.

While trying to simulate the flow for the synthetic jets, the inlet velocity is provided based on the membrane theory.
  Membrane theory : In fluid mechanics, membrane theory implies to the simplified conceptual framework applied to very thin surfaces or structures interacting with the flow. 
  It is applied in the cases involving deformable structures, thin films or interfaces where the surface dynamics significantly influences the fluid flow behavior. ðŸŽƒ
